# Reverse_files
Config files for my GitHub profile.
step 1 copy the reversefile.sh 
step 2 chmod +x reversefile.sh 
step 3 ./reverse.sh
step 4 (input file name enter -the file should present & also in the same dir.)
step 5 (output file automatically created after enter your output file name so no need to create output file before execute code)
This simple bash script reverse the content in the text file 
for eg : [" hi hello " - input ] [ "olleh ih" - output ]
its only run on rev command working system most of the gnu/linux system had rev command 
only different is for run rev command in terminal and script is you can change the whole file into reverse file.
i m new learner so i can do this simple script only :)
